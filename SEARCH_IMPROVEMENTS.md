# Search Improvements Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the enhanced search functionality implemented in the EO Compliance Analysis API. The improvements focus on two main areas:

1. **Plural Search**: Automatically finding both singular and plural forms of keywords
2. **Word Boundary Matching**: Intelligent matching that prevents false positives while allowing legitimate partial matches

## Features Implemented

### 1. Plural Search

The system now automatically generates variants of each keyword to include both singular and plural forms using the `inflect` library.

**Examples:**
- Searching for `identity` will also find `identities`
- Searching for `hormone` will also find `hormones`
- Searching for `survey` will also find `surveys` (if `survey` was in the keyword list)

**Implementation:**
```python
def generate_keyword_variants(keyword: str) -> List[str]:
    """Generate variants of a keyword including plural forms."""
    variants = [keyword.lower()]
    
    # Add plural form if it's different from singular
    plural = p.plural(keyword.lower())
    if plural and plural != keyword.lower():
        variants.append(plural)
    
    # Add singular form if the keyword might be plural
    singular = p.singular_noun(keyword.lower())
    if singular and singular != keyword.lower():
        variants.append(singular)
    
    return list(set(variants))  # Remove duplicates
```

### 2. Word Boundary Matching

The system implements intelligent word boundary matching that:
- Allows partial word matches for legitimate cases (e.g., `mat` in `mathematics`)
- Prevents false positives (e.g., `tea` should NOT match `team` or `teams`)
- Maintains exact matching for spaced keywords (e.g., ` dei `, ` gbv `)

**Key Logic:**
- **Short keywords (≤3 characters)**: Use sophisticated pattern matching with specific exclusion rules
- **Longer keywords**: Use simple substring matching
- **Spaced keywords**: Use exact matching to preserve original behavior

**Examples:**
- ✅ `mat` matches `mathematics` (legitimate partial match)
- ✅ `mat` matches `material` (legitimate partial match)
- ❌ `mat` does NOT match `format` (prevented by word boundary)
- ✅ `tea` matches `tea` (standalone word)
- ❌ `tea` does NOT match `team` (blocked by exclusion rule)
- ❌ `tea` does NOT match `teams` (blocked by exclusion rule)

### 3. Preserved Spaced Keyword Behavior

Keywords with leading/trailing spaces (like ` dei `, ` gbv `, ` mat `) maintain their original exact matching behavior to ensure precision.

## Technical Implementation

### Core Function

The main improvement is in the `extract_sentences_from_text` function:

```python
def extract_sentences_from_text(text: str, keywords: List[str]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Extract sentences containing keywords from text with improved matching."""
    # ... (implementation details in the code)
```

### Key Components

1. **Variant Generation**: Uses the `inflect` library to generate plural/singular forms
2. **Pattern Matching**: Implements regex-based word boundary detection
3. **Exclusion Rules**: Specific rules to prevent known false positives
4. **Fallback Logic**: Different strategies for different keyword types

### Dependencies Added

- `inflect==7.0.0`: For robust plural/singular form generation

## Test Results

The improvements have been thoroughly tested with the following results:

### Plural Search Tests
- ✅ `gender` found in "gender dynamics"
- ✅ `identity` found in "identities were discussed"
- ✅ `hormone` found in "hormone therapy"
- ✅ `hormone` found in "hormones were analyzed"

### Word Boundary Tests
- ✅ `mat` found in "mathematics course"
- ✅ `mat` found in "material was useful"
- ✅ `tea` found in "some tea together"
- ❌ `tea` correctly NOT found in "team works"
- ❌ `tea` correctly NOT found in "teams are working"

## Files Modified

1. **main.py**: Updated with improved search logic
2. **analyze.py**: Updated with the same improvements for consistency
3. **requirements.txt**: Added `inflect==7.0.0` dependency
4. **test_search_improvements.py**: Comprehensive test suite

## Usage

The improvements are automatically applied to all search operations. No changes are required to the API interface - the enhanced functionality works transparently with existing code.

## Performance Considerations

- The plural form generation is cached per keyword to avoid repeated computations
- Regex patterns are optimized for performance
- The system maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for further improvement:
1. Stemming support for more complex word variations
2. Synonym detection
3. Context-aware matching
4. Machine learning-based relevance scoring

## Conclusion

These improvements significantly enhance the search accuracy by:
- Reducing false negatives through plural search
- Reducing false positives through intelligent word boundary matching
- Maintaining precision for critical spaced keywords
- Preserving backward compatibility

The system now provides more comprehensive and accurate keyword matching while maintaining the performance and reliability of the original implementation.
